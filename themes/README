The configuration can also be generated using `lxappearence`
yay -S lxappearence

After installing the themes, use lxappearence to set the gtk2 config:
Widget tab -> Vertex
Color -> nothing
Icon Theme -> Vertex-Icons
Mouse Cursor -> Paper
Font -> Enable antialiasing, Enable hinting, Slight, RGB
Other -> Text beside icons, Large toolbar icon, untick both about images, tick both about sound, untick accessibility

After saving the theme, the config will be stored in ~/.gtkrc-2.0
Finally, make sure that the ~/.config/gtk-3.0 configuration is compatible with the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file
